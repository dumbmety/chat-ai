Effective strategies for optimizing front-end performance in React:
- \`Code-splitting\`: Split your app into smaller chunks for faster loading.
- \`Lazy loading\`: Load components only when they are needed.
- \`Memoization\`: Use \`React.memo()\` or \`useMemo()\` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- \`Avoid unnecessary re-renders\`: Use \`shouldComponentUpdate\` or \`React.memo()\` to prevent re-renders when not needed.

Here's an example of lazy loading a component in React:
\`\`\`javascript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>React App</h1>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  </div>
);

export default App;
\`\`\`
This will load \`LazyComponent\` only when it's required.
